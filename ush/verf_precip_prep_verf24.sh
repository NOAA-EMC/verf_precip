# This script is the intermediate step between 
#  scripts/exverf_precip_verfgen_24h.sh.ecf
# and
#  ush/verf_precip_verf24.sh
# For each item in verf_precip_verf24.domains, this script prepares arguments
#  for ush/verf_precip_verf24.sh, then invokes ush/verf_precip_verf24.sh.
#
# Arguments for verf_precip_verf24.sh:
#  1. Model name
#  2. Verification date/hour
#  3. Verification length
#  4: grids to be verified on
#  5: model cycles
#  6: bucket length
#  7: range of model forecast to be verified.  This is not necessarily the 
#       limit of the model forecast length - e.g. forecast might be out to
#       10 days but only verified for 84 hours, then this number should
#       be '84'.  If this number is '96' and the model has a 12Z cycle,
#       then 96h fcst will be verified.
#  8: special mask?  (nest)

# verf24.domains was created by scripts/exverf_precip_verfgen_24h.sh.sms

#    Since 3-hourly and 24-hourly stats are kept in the same VSDB file, if we
#    make a re-run for the 24-hour, we need to remove the existing 24h stats
#    from the VSDB file and keep the 3h stats.  This is how it is done below:
#      1) Check to see that, within this job, this is the first time "modnam"
#         is being verified (models such as "NAM" might appear multiple times
#         in verf_precip_verfXX.domains, first to be verified over CoNUS, 
#         and again on special sub-regions).  
#      2) If VSDB file for this model/day already exists; if so, delete 
#         all lines containing the string APCP/24 from the VSDB file (in the 
#         case of ConUS verification); or all lines containing 'ASK FHO',
#         'HWI FHO' or 'PUR FHO', in the case of OconUS verif, depending on
#         the particular OConUS region we are verifying.

            # For OConUS verif, delete all VSDB lines with (say) "HWI FHO"

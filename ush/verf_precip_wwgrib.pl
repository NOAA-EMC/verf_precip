# this script reads a "wgrib -V -PDS gribfile"
# and creates a gribscan-like inventory
# by Wesley Ebisuzaki

# for perl beginners
#  \d    matches any digit
#  \d*   matches any number of digits
#  \s    matches any whitespace
#  \S    matches any non-whitespace

# this program works by reading in the very verbose inventory until
# it reads a blank line (end of record) and the parses the inventory
# and writes what it wants

# the tricky part is getting the minutes field which
# is not part of the normal inventory

# verf_precip.v4.3.4.1
verf_precip.v4.3.4 (GEFSv12 para) with gaugeQC dependency removed and RAPv5/HRRRv4 dependencies removed (the RAPv5/HRRRv4 implementation has been delayed until after the GEFSv12 implementation, which was not the case when the GEFSv12 version of the verf_precip code was originally delivered to NCO)
Alex Richert, 29 Sep 2020: implementing what was delivered as v4.3.4.1 (gaugeQC removal+RAP/HRRR stuff) as v4.3.4
